# Urban-Trajecory-Visualization
The project involves a visual analytical system for taxi trajectory data that supports data exploration and analytical reasoning with interactive visual interfaces. The data includes the taxi route information from the city of New York over a certain period of time. It involves latitude, longitude, trip information (distance, speed etc.) and the tripid. Using these factors, we were provided with a prototype to begin with. It involved the area selection in the map to display the trajectories. Our goal was to create three level-1 diagrams (Scatter matrix, word cloud and chord diagram).<br><br>

PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION:<br><br>
• Download 200 OK chrome extension that helps our folder to act as a local server. Then point out the downloaded folder to the 200 OK and click on the link. Once you deploy, you can drag and drop by selecting the small square in the right bottom corner. The visualizations appear on the right.<br><br>
• Selecting a random area helps the system to understand the number of taxis and the trips in that selected portion. Now the region will help to feed the diagrams by their requirements that ultimately ends with interactive diagrams.<br><br>
• Whenever a user selects a region, it develops the trajectory that involves specific area. Here, the red lines show the path of the trip and the small yellow dot describes the point of origin or destination. The trajectory of every taxi in the selected region looks appears as red line. Every red line in the diagram represents a trip across the streets from origin to destination. Thus, the yellow small dot helps to point out the ends of the trip segment.<br>
